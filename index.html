        <strong>Abstract:</strong> This page presents the audio samples for our submitted paper: <strong><em>UniVocal</em>: Unified Speech-Singing Code-Switching Synthesis</strong>. 
        It demonstrates the performance of our proposed method across three different tasks: 
        Speech-Singing Code Switching (SCS) Synthesis, Textual Empathy TTS, and Singing Generation.
        <br><em>Note: All samples are generated unseen during training.</em>
    </p>

    <section id="task1">
        <h2>Task 1: <strong>Speech-Singing Code Switching (SCS) Synthesis</strong></h2>
        <p>In this task, <em>UniVocal</em> generates code-switching audio solely from text input. For visualization purposes, black text denotes speech parts, while <span style="color: #e74c3c;">red text</span> indicates singing parts.</p>

        <h3>1. Implicit cues only: In the 'Implicit cues only' condition, <em>UniVocal</em> generates SCS audio solely based on the inherent semantic and stylistic differences between the speech and singing parts in the text.</h3>

My solitary light.</td>
